# unsilence-helper
A windows installer for everything required for https://github.com/lagmoellertim/unsilence and a helper wrapper script to run it for the slightly less tech literate. To install just run Install.bat once as Admin. Then you can place Unsilence-Helper.bat in the same folder as the file you're aiming it at, double-click to run it, and follow the on-screen instrunctions! :)
